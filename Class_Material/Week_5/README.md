# BCB 546X -- Week 5

R Week#1! The format for this week presentation will be different as I'm using the Software Carpentry template for their "R for Reproducible Scientific Analysis" workshop. All the materials will be available here: ["R Data Skills"](https://eeob-biodata.github.io/R-Data-Skills). 
The workshop is written in RMarkdown, but its rendering as HTML site is somewhat a miracle to me :) In any case, you may check the R Markdown files at [https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/R-Data-Skills/tree/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd](https://github.com/EEOB-BioData/R-Data-Skills/tree/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd).

I added a new file to this directory: v59i10.pdf, which we'll discuss on 2/14/17
