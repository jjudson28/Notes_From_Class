# BCB 546X -- Week 2

## 17 Jan -- Remote Machines & Intro to Version Control using Git

You can find the slides in the file called [`lecture_17Jan-TAH.html`](http://eeob-biodata.github.io/BCB546X-Spring2017/Week_2/lecture_17Jan-TAH.html#1). This presentation was written in Markdown using [remark](https://remarkjs.com/#1) which creates a HTML slideshow. You should be able to open the lecture file directly in your web browser. As long as the `.html` file is in the same directory as the `images` directory and you are connected to the internet, you should be able to see the whole slide show. Otherwise, you can view it on the web using the link.

## 19 January -- More Fun with Git

The lecture notes are in the file called [`lecture_19Jan-TAH.html`](http://eeob-biodata.github.io/BCB546X-Spring2017/Week_2/lecture_19Jan-TAH.html#1).
