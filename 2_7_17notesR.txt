command enter #line in the script will be executed in the console
#variables cannot start with a digit
option - #allows the quick insertion of <-
ls () #tells you what variables are stored to the environment
ls #just gives you the code for the function ls
rm variable #removes the variable 'variable'
rm(list = ls()) #removes all variables 
ls(all.names=TRUE) #lists all variables including hidden variables
?function #pulls up the help page for the function 'function'
library(package) #loads the package into the R environment
install.packages("package") #installs a package

#R Notebook allows an executable lab notebook file
#also can do an R Markdown file
??function # allows a search of the r database.
typeof(function) #check what type of vector the data is
#vectors are always flat, can combine vectors without parentheses, no nested structures
#missing values indicated by NA
#quotation marks will prevent R from reading as a variable, numbers are not variables
#The coercion rules go: logical -> integer -> double -> complex -> character, where -> can be read as are transformed into. You can try to force coercion against this flow using the as. functions
#variables must be the same type to be combined.
str(x) #tells you everything in your list vector
list(list(list)) #you can have lists within lists using this command, c(list) will just give you an unnested vector
#objects have attributes that describe them
names(x) #character vector names are listed
#A factor is a vector that can contain only predefined values, and is used to store categorical data, can change characters into integers
