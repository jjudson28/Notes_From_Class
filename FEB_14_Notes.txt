Notes for February 14
can use specific names to call an item in a vector, can use logical, can use ranges
data frames are 2 dimensional structures
lists can have heterogeneous structures
cats[1] gives a list
cats[[1]] gives a vector
you can subset a dataframe to remove columns you don't want
rows are lists rather than vectors

Notes for Feb. 16th
for homework, use the R notebook in R to take notes on your assignment, save the file as an R notebook
each column must be consistent in data type, but diff columns can have diff. vector types (character/integer)
data frames are heterogeneous
cats[row:column]
cats[c(1,3)] #gives you column 1 and column 3
cats[1,3] #gives you data from row 1, column 3 (single data point)
write.csv(cats, file = "data/new_cats.csv") #saves the dataframe back to a file
str(d) #gives structure of d
dim(d) #gives number of rows and columns
#can use drop command to return a dataframe
table(d$cent) #allows summary of column in a table format
#can use the history in Rstudio to transfer commands to a file
d[d$total.SNPs >= 85, ] #can pull out the observations that fit the criteria and are TRUE
summary(d$Pi[d$cent]) #pulls out summary statistics for Pi when centromeric region is TRUE
summary(d$Pi[d$cent == TRUE]) #equivalent to above command
which(d$Pi > 3) #gives row numbers for where the command is TRUE
download.file #to download zipped files
read.delim #reads in tab delimited files
