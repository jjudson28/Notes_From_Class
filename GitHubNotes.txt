Notes on Chapter 5
	
	Version control is important for collaborative and individual projects. 
git status		#checks status of the repository
	Branch master is the default branch
git add			#tracks a certain file in the repository
	There is a staging area that working files must be transferred to before committing them to github
git commit -m "initial import"		#commits the file to the repository with a note that it is the initial import
-a									#tag added to allow all changes to be staged, then commit command with it will commit all
git diff		#shows all changes made to the files that are uncommitted
	Can change the color of these texts to show where changes were made
git log			#shows our chain of commits
	Can force git to ignore some files if they are large
git reset		#resets our staging area if we don't want to commit something just yet.
