Notes 1/24/17

Kernel: the inside part of the computer
interact using the shell
echo $ Shell		#show your shell
remember to specify the type of file you are creating


program < inputfile > outputfile				#both of these commands are the same effectively
cat inputfile | program > outputfile			#these are the most common input types, pipe the input file to the program
mkdir		#make directory folder
#making subfolders in data
data/seqs		#creates subfolder in data called seqs
cd ../..	#takes you two directories up

SPACES IN FILENAMES ARE BAD!!! use quotation marks to get around this
rm -rf deletes directory and all subfolders
mkdir -p		#allows making subfolders within new directory, use brackets
ls -R #shows all children files under directories
touch #creates a file not a directory
wildcards: ? matches a single character, * multiple characters matched after asterisk

ls zmaysA* #allows list of all with matching characters
ls zmays?_R1.fastq #just pulls up all that match with exception of no letter specified
mv zmays[AB]_R1* R1	#allows the movement of files with either a or b into R1 directory
mv zmays[AB]_R2* R2
#can give the parentheses a range of letters, not numbers
rm -rf tmp-data/aligned-reads * #will remove all files in the current directory
^ #only match things at the beginning of the line
-v #don't include any line that starts with the greater than symbol
--color #print a different color on the screen
-i #makes grep insensitive to case of letters
^ within bracket #matches anything but this, gives non-dna letters within your file

tee	#program that writes to intermediate file without disrupting the pipe
& #run the program in the background, the process ID is very important
jobs #tells you which programs you currently have running
fg %processIDNo #brings process to the foreground so you can see the job in your terminal
##DO NOT EXIT OUR OF YOUR TERMINAL APPLICATION WITH BACKGROUND PROCESSES!!!
ps #process ids listed, can also use job id to call jobs
nohup #can close application and still run it
screen #a command used in R to continue running a process after closing terminal
ctrl z #pauses program so that you can use bg to send to background
echo $? #will give a zero for exit status if there were no errors in the programs run, can incorporate into pipe
&& #telling pipe to continue if first program error status is 0
|| #tells your program what to do if the first program gives an error status of 1
ctrl a #takes you to beginning of code line
grep -c #counting lines
mkdir results-$(date +%F) #creates a folder entitled results with the current date
#homebrew allows easy installation of dependencies of all different kinds of programs
brew libsequence # accesses brew and installs the program
.bash_profile #if you ls -a and find this file and open it, you can set up an alias for diff commands
alias nuke='rm -f' #demo of an alias
head -n #indicate number of lines you want
tail n+2 #removes header, first two lines of file
