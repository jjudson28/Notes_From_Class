Notes Feb 28:

#ipython can run blocks of script
#pythonw is good for opening other files, ect. in mac

#can run python within unix by coding
python filename

#jupyter notebooks
jupyter notebook #start a notebook in the terminal
#can change the type of code to markdown, shift enter will enter the part in the notebook
#need to be in the desired directory before opening jupyter


ctrl-d #quits the python interpreter

#in python, lists are like R vectors
numbers = [1,2,3]
numbers[0] #gives you the first number in the list

#for loops don't require an explicit variable made before the loop, ex:
for num in numbers:
    print(num)  #must indent 4 spaces in a loop
    
#append numbers onto a list
numbers.append(4) #appends the number 4 to the created numbers list from above

#get help
help(list) #gives all method options for commands to apply to list

#method vs. command

#once you create a tuple, CANNOT change the values inside a tuple

#R isn't as good with large datasets
#citing code using sha and the link to the repository in code, cite in paper as well
#pay attention to indentation!!
#can change a tuple only by using a complete replace of the tuple

type(my_tuple) #gives the type of whatever element is in the parentheses

#dictionary uses curly brackets

numbers[0] = 'zero' #appends the key for 0 into the dictionary numbers

##can't use a list in a dictionary because not a hashable object

if 4 not in numbers2:
    numbers2[4] = 'four'	#can create a loop to make sure you don't overwrite an existing key
numbers2

items	#returns key and value of dictionary

""" #can use to define long strings of text
def #define function

pip #way to fast install python packages
import #like library function for R

import numpy as np #can call packages by different terms to abbreviate

surveys_df.dtypes #gives you types within the columns
#object is string
#float is a decimal
