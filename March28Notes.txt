Notes March 28

Latex!
it's free!
really flexible
automation of many tasks including bibliographies and cross referencing
document format changes can be done with just one line of code
based on portable files (plain text) sharing is easy, can do via github, ect and can use diff tools in github
easy rendering of math equations and graphics
online editors exist, you can make modular files that compile into a single pdf
you can comment out sentences or paragraphs based on conditional statements
Disadvantages: substantial learning curve, it is challenging to collaborate with those
who don't use it. error messages are cryptic, can take some effort to figure things out,
if your file is really large like a presentation it can take a minute to render as pdf

What you see is what you get programs, like Word:
	good tools, easy gui interface
	almost everyone is knowledgeable on these programs
Disadvantages include cost, formatting can be challenging, terrible for equations, files
can be difficult to manage using version control, bibliography stuff can be tough,
default autoformatting, often cannot take formats from old versions of word, new ect.

overleaf or sharelatex
texpad for mac
JabRef #work with bibliography to get bibTex format
